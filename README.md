# Sudoku-Solver-by-Backtracking
The Backtracking Algorithm is a recursive search technique used to systematically explore potential solutions to combinatorial problems. It is particularly effective when there are multiple choices and constraints involved in finding a valid solution.

One of the most powerful and widely used approaches to solve Sudoku puzzles is the Backtracking Technique.

Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally.

There are three types of problems in backtracking:

1. Decision Problem – In this, we search for a feasible solution.
2. Optimization Problem – In this, we search for the best solution.
 3. Enumeration Problem – In this, we find all feasible solutions.
